# üöÄ Deploy to Netlify in 60 Seconds

## Option 1: Instant Deploy (Easiest)

**The `dist` folder is already built!** Just drag it to Netlify:

1. Open https://app.netlify.com/drop in your browser
2. Drag the **`dist`** folder from your project
3. Drop it on the page
4. Done! Your site is live! üéâ

## Option 2: CLI Deploy (Fastest)

Copy and paste these commands:

```powershell
# Install Netlify CLI (only once)
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy
cd c:\Project\assigment-9\assigment-9
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

---

## Option 3: Continuous Deployment (Best Practice)

```powershell
# Initialize Git (if not already)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"

# Push to GitHub
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
git push -u origin main
```

Then:
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Click "Add new site" ‚Üí "Import an existing project"
3. Choose GitHub and select your repo
4. Build command: `npm run build`
5. Publish directory: `dist`
6. Click "Deploy site"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è After Deployment - CRITICAL!

**Add your Netlify URL to Firebase:**

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select project: `email-pass-auth-37764`
3. Go to: Authentication ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Authorized domains
4. Click "Add domain"
5. Enter: `your-site-name.netlify.app`
6. Save

**Without this, authentication won't work!**
